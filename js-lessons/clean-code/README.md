# clean code

Meaningful Names: Use descriptive and clear names for variables, functions, classes, and modules. This makes the code self-documenting and easier to understand for anyone reading it.

Single Responsibility Principle: Each function or class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This promotes modularity, reusability, and testability.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid code duplication.  If a piece of logic needs to be used in multiple places, extract it into a function or reusable component.

KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid): Strive for simplicity in your code design and implementation. Complex code is harder to understand, maintain, and test.

Comments (Sparingly):  Write clear and concise comments to explain non-obvious code or complex logic. However, comments should not simply repeat what the code is already doing.

Consistent Formatting:  Use consistent indentation, spacing, and other formatting conventions throughout your codebase. This improves readability and maintainability.

Error Handling:  Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to help diagnose issues.

Testing:  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your code. This helps catch bugs early and ensures your code continues to function as intended with future changes.

Abstraction:  Use abstraction techniques like functions and classes to hide implementation details and expose only the essential functionality. This improves code reusability and maintainability.

Efficiency (Consider When Needed):  Optimize your code for performance when necessary. However, prioritize readability and maintainability in most cases. Premature optimization can be wasteful and make code harder to understand.
